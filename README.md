UNDER CONSTRUCTION

I'm in the process of updating CiderPress to work with newer tools (VS 2013) and operating systems.

Current status:
- Win32 main application compiles and can execute basic functions, but there are still big pieces missing.
- MDC application can't get past the initial "choose files" dialog.
- Linux code doesn't compile.
- The web documentation has been moved to github (see the gh-pages branch) and is
  available from http://a2ciderpress.com/.
