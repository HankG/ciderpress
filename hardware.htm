<h1>CiderPress Hardware Compatibility</h1>
<p>CiderPress can access floppy disks, CD-ROMs, CF cards, hard drives, and other
devices.&nbsp; Whether or not it can do so on your system depends on the
specific set of devices you have and what version of Windows you're running.&nbsp;

<h3>General Rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>3.5&quot; floppy disks
    <ul>
      <li>Requires a 3.5&quot; floppy drive in your PC.&nbsp; Works under both
        Win98/ME and Win2K/XP.</li>
      <li>Only 720KB and 1.4MB PC-format floppy disks are supported.&nbsp;
        Apple-format 800KB and 1.6MB disks are not, due to hardware
        differences.&nbsp; Apple-format 140K 5.25&quot; disks are not supported
        either.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CompactFlash (CF) cards
    <ul>
      <li>Requires a CF card reader.</li>
      <li>Your ability to read CF cards in CiderPress depends upon your exact
        model of reader and which operating system you're running.&nbsp; Check
        the compatibility list, below.</li>
      <li>Cards can use CFFA fixed-partition format or the custom partitioning
        from SHH Systeme's MicroDrive system.</li>
      <li>CiderPress does not
        currently provide formatting or partitioning facilities.&nbsp; You must
        prepare the card on the Apple II.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CD-ROMs
    <ul>
      <li>Requires a CD-ROM drive.&nbsp; Internal SCSI and IDE drives have been
        tested successfully under Win98/ME and Win2K/XP.&nbsp; External USB
        CD-ROM drives may not work.</li>
      <li>Works for Macintosh-partitioned CD-ROMs.</li>
      <li>CiderPress does not record discs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hard drives
    <ul>
      <li>Requires an appropriate interface to connect the hard drive, e.g. you
        need a SCSI adapter in your PC to read a SCSI hard drive.</li>
      <li>Under Win2K/XP, the device must be recognized by the BIOS (SCSI or
        IDE; FireWire might work but has not been tested).</li>
      <li>Under Win98/ME, it must be recognized by ASPI (usually SCSI
        only).&nbsp; See Win98/ME notes below.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ZIP drives
    <ul>
      <li>ZIP disks have been used successfully.&nbsp; Make sure you partition
        the disk, e.g. with ADU or RamFAST utilities on the Apple II.&nbsp; If
        you insert a blank disk in a IIgs, and let the Finder format it as a
        simple ProDOS volume, the disk won't work if you eject and re-insert it.</li>
      <li>You may need drivers to use a ZIP drive on a PC.&nbsp; SCSI drives
        will probably work without them.</li>
      <li>Parallel-port ZIP drives do not work well with CiderPress under
        Win9x/ME.&nbsp; You can read from them, but writing fails.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Other devices
    <ul>
      <li>Insite SCSI &quot;floptical&quot; drives, made popular on the Apple II by
        Tulin, have been successfully tested under Win98 and Win2K.&nbsp; No
        additional drivers needed on the PC.</li>
      <li>Tape drives are not supported.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Win2K/XP
    <ul>
      <li>You need &quot;administrator&quot; privileges to access devices other
        than floppy disk drives.&nbsp; This is a general OS limitation on
        low-level access to devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Win98/ME
    <ul>
      <li>Access to CD-ROM drives and hard drives is limited to what your ASPI
        layer is capable of handling.&nbsp; &quot;ASPI&quot; is an acronym for
        Advanced SCSI Programming Interface, and provides a layer between
        applications and SCSI devices.&nbsp; It also provides an interface for
        IDE CD-ROM drives, and may work for other devices depending on which
        ASPI implementation you have.</li>
      <li>Microsoft provides a generic ASPI layer that is commonly replaced when
        CD recording software is installed.&nbsp; Adaptec/Roxio provides one
        implementation, Ahead's Nero provides another.&nbsp; All of these will
        work just fine with CD-ROM drives, but access to other devices may be
        affected by the currently installed version.</li>
      <li>Your SCSI card must be ASPI-compliant.&nbsp; Nearly all cards
        are.&nbsp; Adaptec 2940-series cards have been tested, as have some
        older Symbios/LSI Logic cards (e.g. Diamond FirePort).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>As the saying goes, &quot;your mileage may vary&quot;.&nbsp; The only way to
know for certain if something will work is to try it and see.</p>

<p>One common problem in Win98 is refusal by the CF reader driver to allow
access to unrecognized logical volumes (&quot;logical volumes&quot; are lettered
drives, like &quot;C:&quot;).&nbsp; In such cases, the card will not even show
up in the logical volume list.&nbsp; Win2K and WinXP are usually better about
this.</p>
<p>Depending on your hardware and software configuration, you may be able to
open your card reader by name (e.g. &quot;SanDisk Imagemate II        Direct-access
device&quot;), rather than drive letter.&nbsp; In this case
you're actually using the ASPI layer to access the device, which is a little
strange since CF card readers aren't SCSI and don't work like CD-ROM
drives.&nbsp; This does appear to work for reading, but fails for writing.&nbsp;
Depending on which ASPI implementation you have installed, writes may be
rejected or may appear to succeed but not actually go through.</p>
<p>Thus far, no fully-functioning CF configuration for Win98/ME has been found.</p>
