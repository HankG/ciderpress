<p><b>Manage large archives</b>.&nbsp; This shows CiderPress viewing a large
collection of files -- in this case, a ShrinkIt file archive of a 20MB hard drive partition
with source code on it.&nbsp; For compactness, the archive was re-compressed with the gzip
&quot;deflate&quot; algorithm.&nbsp; (Re-compressing the entire archive took 3
mouse clicks and about 10 seconds, and cut the compressed size significantly.)</p>
<p>ShrinkIt archives up to 2GB and multi-partition hard drives up to 8GB are
supported.</p>
<p>The file viewer is showing an Applesoft BASIC program, converted to text that
exactly matches the output of the &quot;LIST&quot; command.&nbsp; The color
syntax highlighting shown can be switched off.&nbsp; The file view can be
changed to a hex dump or a raw file dump with one click.</p>
